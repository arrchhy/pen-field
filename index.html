    Penfield (Penfield Technologies Inc.) is a company that is not supposed to exist, co-founded by <a href="http://0a.io/">Archy Wilhes</a>, Fabrizio Beverina, and Marc Archer, registered in Delaware, U.S. Its name is inspired by a fictional company in Philip K. Dick's novel <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i>

  <div class="aboutArchy session" style="width:450px;">
    Penfield is a failed experiment to bring Ivi (now <a href="http://kindyu.com">KindyU</a>, a spin-off UK company owned by Marc Archer) and Mood Organ alive. Penfield is just one of the hundreds and thousands of start-ups that didn't work out.

  Since Penfield is a legal entity enrolled in the Apple Developer Program, it is now being by <a href="http://0a.io/">Archy Wilhes</a> (the then CEO) used as a placeholder on the App Store to distribute his own apps for the time being (before he signs up for another legal entity, transfers his apps to it, and files a Certificate of Dissolution for Penfield).
